# genomic_bottleneck_v2

Training a Bayesian neural network version of the genomic bottleneck for RL tasks.

We focus on continuous control and use the high throughput brax simulator.

Our training code is modified from: [here](https://github.com/google/brax/blob/main/notebooks/training_torch.ipynb).
